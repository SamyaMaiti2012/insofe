In this class, we will look at basics of RMarkdown and how to generate an html file from it.

## Installations   
Install the package - 'rmarkdown' with all its dependencies. 

## Code Chunk
 this is a sentence
```{r }

```
 
 - You can quickly insert chunks like these into your file with
    - the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)
    - the Add Chunk `Insert` command in the editor toolbar
    - or by typing the chunk delimiters $```{r}$ and $```$

## How it works
![How it works](img/rmarkdownflow.png)
 
 - When you run render, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to knitr ???, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and it???s output.

 - The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc ??? which is responsible for creating the finished format. [reference: 1]

 - knitr can execute code in many languages besides R. Some of the available language engines include:
    - Python
    - SQL
    - Bash
    - Rcpp
    - Stan
    - JavaScript
    - CSS
  - To process a code chunk using an alternate language engine, replace the r at the start of your chunk declaration with the name of the language
  
```{python}

print ("This chunk is run using python")

```

##  Code Chunk Options  
Chunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the {} of a chunk header[reference: 1] :   
  * include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.  
  * echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.  
  * message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.  
  * warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.

#### Some other commonly used symbols   
**Sigma:**  $\sigma$  
**Pi:**  $\pi$   
**Alpha:**  $\alpha$  
**Lambda:**  $\lambda$    
**Greater than or equal to:**  $\ge$  
**Less than or equal to:** $\le$  
**Plus or minus:**  $\pm$  

## Lets write some R code now 
#### 1. View the data
```{r}
volcanic_data = faithful
head(volcanic_data)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(volcanic_data[1:6,], caption = "Volcanic data table in a neat way")
```


#### 2. Let us do a scatter plot
```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(volcanic_data)
```

#### 3. What is the summary of the dataset
```{r}
summary(volcanic_data)
```

## Practice   
1. Refer to the lecture notes and write the following equations in Rmarkdown:   

  * mean
  * median
  * variance
  * standard deviation
  * IQR

## Examples of Equations
  - Mean
$${\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}}$$
 - Median
$$median = ({\frac{n+1}{2}})^{th} (positon~of~the~sorted~data)$$
  
2. Read in the internal dataset mtcars and see the summary of the dataset in Rmakrdown. Report the mean of horse power (column hp) as hp_bar = xxx value  (write hp_bar in equation notations)  
```{r}
cars_data = mtcars
summary(mtcars)
m = mean(mtcars$cyl)
```

The mean of number of cylinders is:
$$ \bar{cyl} = `r m`$$
